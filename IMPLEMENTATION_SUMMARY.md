# Enemy Tank Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the enemy tank feature for the GTA-style game. The tank is a new vehicle type that appears when the player's wanted level reaches 6, providing a significant challenge.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tank Class (`js/entities/Tank.js`)
- Created a new `Tank` class that extends the `Vehicle` class
- Implemented tank-specific properties:
  - Weapon cooldowns and timers
  - Turret angle for directional targeting
  - Primary weapon range (500 pixels)
  - Armor thickness for damage reduction
- Added tank-specific AI behavior:
  - Targeting and tracking the player
  - Positioning for optimal firing angles
  - Firing primary cannon and secondary machine gun
- Implemented armor system with directional damage reduction:
  - Front armor: 80% damage reduction
  - Side armor: 60% damage reduction
  - Rear armor: 40% damage reduction
- Added visual effects:
  - Muzzle flash for weapons
  - Exhaust smoke particles
  - Detailed tank rendering with turret
- Implemented audio effects:
  - Cannon fire sound
  - Machine gun sound
  - Damage sounds
  - Explosion sounds

### 2. Vehicle Types (`js/vehicles.js`)
- Added `TANK` vehicle type to `VEHICLE_TYPES` constant:
  - Width: 60 pixels (length)
  - Height: 30 pixels (width)
  - Health: 300 (much higher than regular vehicles)
  - Mass: 8.0 (very heavy)
  - Max speed: 0.8 (slow but powerful)
  - Acceleration: 0.03
  - Turn speed: 0.01 (turns very slowly)
  - Colors: Military colors (`#4a4a4a`, `#333333`, `#555555`)
  - Spawn weight: 0 (never spawns randomly)

### 3. Game System Integration (`js/game.js`)
- Added `tanks` array to track tank entities
- Modified `updatePoliceResponse()` to spawn tanks at wanted level 6
- Added `updateTankSpawning()` method:
  - Limits to 2-3 tanks maximum on screen
  - Uses 'roadblock' spawning method for ambush scenarios
  - Low spawn chance (0.5% per frame)
- Added tank updates to the main game loop
- Integrated tanks with:
  - Spatial grid system for collision detection
  - Rendering system with LOD support
  - Collision detection system
  - Memory management system

### 4. Combat System (`js/bullets.js`)
- Updated `shouldCheckCollision()` to include tanks as valid targets
- Updated `checkCollisionsBruteForce()` to handle tank collisions
- Added scoring for tank destruction (500 points)
- Updated `damageNearbyEntities()` to include tanks in explosion radius

### 5. Audio System (`js/audio.js`)
- Added new sound effects for tanks:
  - `tank_cannon`: Deep cannon fire sound
  - `tank_machinegun`: Rapid machine gun fire
  - `tank_spawn`: Heavy mechanical spawning sound
  - `tank_explosion`: Massive explosion sound
  - `tank_damage`: Metallic damage sound

### 6. UI Integration (`index.html`)
- Added script tag to load the Tank class

## Testing
- Created unit tests for tank functionality:
  - Tank creation and property validation
  - Armor system damage calculation
  - Inheritance from Vehicle class
- All tests pass successfully

## Performance Considerations
- Implemented object pooling for tank bullets and particles
- Added Level of Detail (LOD) support for rendering optimization
- Limited maximum tanks on screen to prevent performance issues
- Integrated with spatial grid for efficient collision detection

## Game Balance
- High health (300) makes tanks durable but not invincible
- Slow movement speed (0.8 max) makes them vulnerable to evasion
- Directional armor system provides strategic weak points
- Powerful weapons require player to maintain distance
- Worth 500 points to reward successful tank destruction

## Future Enhancements
- Add visual damage states for tanks
- Implement different tank variants with unique abilities
- Add tank-specific missions or challenges
- Enhance AI with more sophisticated tactical behavior
