# Zone Guaranteed Spawning System

## Overview
Updated the zone spawning system to ensure at least one of each essential zone type spawns in every world, preventing situations where players can't access critical facilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Guaranteed Zone Types
Every world now spawns at least one of each:
- **Safe House** - Refuge and healing
- **Hospital** - Health restoration
- **Police Station** - High-risk area
- **Weapon Shop** - Weapon upgrades
- **Garage** - Vehicle spawning
- **Black Market** - Special items

### 2. Improved Placement Logic

#### Buffer Zones
- Added 10-pixel buffer around zone buildings
- Prevents tight overlaps with roads and buildings
- Ensures proper spacing between structures

#### Better Collision Detection
- Checks overlap with roads (with buffer)
- Checks overlap with existing buildings (with buffer)
- Checks overlap with other zone buildings
- Minimum 100-unit distance between zones

#### Road Access Validation
- Must be within 150 units of a road
- Uses closest point calculation for accuracy
- Ensures all zones are accessible

### 3. Spawn Process

#### Phase 1: Guaranteed Zones
```javascript
// Create one of each essential type first
for (const type of guaranteedZones) {
    createRandomZone(type);
}
```

#### Phase 2: Additional Zones
```javascript
// Add more zones for variety
additionalZones.forEach(zoneGroup => {
    for (let i = 0; i < zoneGroup.count; i++) {
        createRandomZone(zoneGroup.type);
    }
});
```

### 4. Placement Attempts
- Increased from 50 to 100 attempts per zone
- Added 50-pixel margin from city edges
- Logs warnings if placement fails
- Returns success/failure status

### 5. Helper Methods

#### `hasAllEssentialZones()`
Checks if all essential zone types exist in the world.

#### `getMissingEssentialZones()`
Returns array of missing essential zone types.

#### `getZoneStats()`
Returns count of each zone type in the world.

## Benefits

1. **Guaranteed Access** - Players always have access to all essential facilities
2. **Better Distribution** - Zones are properly spaced and accessible
3. **No Overlaps** - Zone buildings won't spawn on roads or overlap other buildings
4. **Debugging** - Console logs show which zones were created successfully
5. **Reliability** - Increased attempts and better validation ensure successful placement

## Technical Details

### Collision Detection
```javascript
// Check with buffer
rectOverlap(
    x - buffer, y - buffer, 
    width + buffer * 2, height + buffer * 2,
    otherX, otherY, otherWidth, otherHeight
)
```

### Road Distance Calculation
```javascript
// Find closest point on road to zone center
const closestX = Math.max(road.x, Math.min(centerX, road.x + road.width));
const closestY = Math.max(road.y, Math.min(centerY, road.y + road.height));
const distance = Math.sqrt(
    Math.pow(centerX - closestX, 2) +
    Math.pow(centerY - closestY, 2)
);
```

## Console Output
When zones are created, you'll see:
```
Creating guaranteed zone buildings...
✓ Created SAFE_HOUSE
✓ Created HOSPITAL
✓ Created POLICE_STATION
✓ Created WEAPON_SHOP
✓ Created GARAGE
✓ Created BLACK_MARKET
Total zones created: 15 (excluding spawn points)
```

## Future Improvements
- Add retry logic for failed placements
- Distribute zones across different districts
- Ensure zones are spread across the map (not clustered)
- Add zone placement visualization in debug mode
