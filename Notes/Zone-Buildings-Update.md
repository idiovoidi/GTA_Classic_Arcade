# Zone Buildings Update

## Problem

Zone buildings (hospital, gun shop, police station, etc.) were:
- ‚ùå Just highlighted areas with no actual structure
- ‚ùå Could spawn on roads
- ‚ùå No collision detection
- ‚ùå Looked like overlays, not real buildings
- ‚ùå Could overlap with other buildings

## Solution

Converted zones into **actual buildings** with proper collision and placement!

## What Changed

### 1. Real Buildings ‚úÖ

Each zone now creates an actual `Building` instance:
- **Walls** - Destructible walls around perimeter
- **Support beams** - Indestructible corner supports
- **Windows** - Breakable edge windows
- **Roof** - Proper roof that goes transparent when inside
- **Collision** - Full collision detection

### 2. No Road Spawning ‚úÖ

Zones now check for road overlap:
```javascript
// Check if overlaps with roads
for (const road of this.game.city.roads) {
    if (overlaps) return false; // Don't spawn here!
}
```

### 3. Building Overlap Prevention ‚úÖ

Zones check for existing buildings:
```javascript
// Check if overlaps with existing buildings
for (const building of this.game.city.buildings) {
    if (overlaps) return false;
}
```

### 4. Road Access Required ‚úÖ

Zones must be near (but not on) a road:
```javascript
// Must be within 100 units of a road
if (distanceToRoad < 100 && !onRoad) {
    return true; // Good location!
}
```

### 5. Color-Coded Buildings ‚úÖ

Each zone type has unique colors:

| Zone | Color Scheme |
|------|-------------|
| Hospital | Pink (#ff0080) |
| Police Station | Blue (#0000ff) |
| Gun Shop | Yellow (#ffff00) |
| Garage | Orange (#ff8800) |
| Black Market | Purple (#800080) |
| Safe House | Green (#00ff00) |

   + Dashed border showing it's a zone
   + Never spawns on roads
   + Full collision detection
```

## Rendering Order

1. **Building** - Rendered first (floor, walls, windows, roof)
2. **Zone overlay** - Subtle highlight (15% opacity)
3. **Zone border** - Dashed line (60% opacity)
4. **Zone icon** - On the roof with background circle
5. **Zone label** - When player is inside
6. **Interaction prompt** - "Press E to interact"

## Building Features

### Hospital
- Pink building (#ff0080)
- Commercial building type
- Breakable windows
- Transparent roof when inside
- Heals player when interacting

### Police Station
- Blue building (#0000ff)
- Commercial building type
- Spawns police patrols
- High alert area
- Increases wanted level if trespassing

### Gun Shop
- Yellow building (#ffff00)
- Commercial building type
- Weapon upgrades
- Ammo refills

### Garage
- Orange building (#ff8800)
- Industrial building type
- Vehicle spawning
- Vehicle repairs

### Black Market
- Purple building (#800080)
- Commercial building type
- Special items
- Power-ups

### Safe House
- Green building (#00ff00)
- Residential building type
- Health regeneration
- Wanted level decay

## Spawn Logic

### Location Requirements
1. ‚úÖ Not on roads
2. ‚úÖ Not overlapping buildings
3. ‚úÖ Within 100 units of a road
4. ‚úÖ 150+ units from other zones
5. ‚úÖ Within city bounds

### Spawn Attempts
- Tries 50 different locations
- Picks first suitable location
- Fails gracefully if no location found

## Code Changes

**File:** `js/zones.js`

**New Methods:**
- `createZoneBuilding()` - Creates actual building for zone
- `rectOverlap()` - Checks rectangle overlap

**Modified Methods:**
- `Zone constructor` - Now creates building
- `isLocationSuitable()` - Checks roads and buildings
- `render()` - Renders building first, then overlay
- `renderZoneIcon()` - Icon with background circle

**New Properties:**
- `zone.building` - Reference to Building instance

## Benefits

1. **Realistic** - Zones are actual buildings, not overlays
2. **Collision** - Can't drive through zone buildings
3. **Destructible** - Can shoot windows and walls
4. **Tactical** - Can use buildings for cover
5. **Immersive** - Feels like real city structures
6. **No bugs** - Won't spawn on roads or overlap

## Gameplay Impact

### Before
- Zones felt like UI elements
- Could drive through them
- No tactical value
- Confusing placement

### After
- Zones are real buildings
- Must navigate around them
- Can use for cover
- Clear, logical placement

## Performance

- ‚úÖ No performance impact
- ‚úÖ Buildings use existing system
- ‚úÖ Efficient collision detection
- ‚úÖ LOD-ready for optimization

## Testing

1. **Start game** - Zones spawn as buildings
2. **Check placement** - No zones on roads
3. **Enter building** - Roof goes transparent
4. **Shoot windows** - Windows break
5. **Check collision** - Can't drive through walls
6. **Use zone** - Press E to interact

## Future Enhancements

- Interior furniture for each zone type
- Multiple floors for larger zones
- Unique architectural features per zone
- Dynamic zone upgrades
- Zone damage affects functionality

## Result

Zones are now **proper buildings** with walls, roofs, windows, and collision! They never spawn on roads, look realistic, and integrate perfectly with the city. Much better than floating highlighted areas! üè•üî´üè†
